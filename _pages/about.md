I am Yibo Peng, a Research Assistant at Carnegie Mellon University. Advised by Prof. Beidi Chen, my research focuses on the security of AI agents([https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/FCV](https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/FCV)). I also collaborate with Prof. Huaxiu Yao on multimodel large language models ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00555](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00555)) and with Prof. Graham Neubig([https://www.phontron.com/](https://www.phontron.com/)) on code agents through the OpenHands([https://docs.all-hands.dev/](https://docs.all-hands.dev/)). Previously, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research.

I recently received my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. During my studies, I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. Daniel Fried(link: [https://dpfried.github.io/](https://dpfried.github.io/)), with a focus on Code Generation and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)(link: [https://openreview.net/pdf?id=pmcWo9DtDw](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=pmcWo9DtDw)).

My research interests lie in addressing the core challenges for AI agents: enhancing their multimodal reasoning capabilities in complex environments, optimizing the efficiency of multi-agent collaboration, and ensuring the safety of their behavior.

I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities for the Fall 2026 admission cycle. If you are interested in my work or potential collaborations, please feel free to contact me via email(link：[yibopcmu@gmail.com](mailto:yibopcmu@gmail.com)).
