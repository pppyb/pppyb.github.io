I am **Yibo Peng**, a Research Assistant at **Carnegie Mellon University**. Advised by Prof. **Beidi Chen**, my research focuses on the [security of AI agents](https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/FCV). I also collaborate with Prof. **Huaxiu Yao** on [multimodel large language models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00555) and with Prof. **Graham Neubig** on [code agents](https://www.phontron.com/) through the [OpenHands](https://docs.all-hands.dev/). Previously, I was a research intern at **Microsoft Research**.

I recently received my **Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering** from **Carnegie Mellon University**. During my studies, I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. [**Daniel Fried**](https://dpfried.github.io/), with a focus on **Code Generation** and [**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=pmcWo9DtDw).

My research interests lie in addressing the core challenges for AI agents: **enhancing their multimodal reasoning capabilities** in complex environments, **optimizing the efficiency of multi-agent collaboration**, and **ensuring the safety of their behavior**.

I am actively seeking **Ph.D. opportunities for the Fall 2026 admission cycle**. If you are interested in my work or potential collaborations, please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:yibopcmu@gmail.com).
